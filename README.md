# HelloWorld
Hello World - This is my first venture into GitHub.

While sitting on the bench, I have wasted many days idling around.
Instead of that, now I am looking into learning something new.
The learnings I have in my mind are:

 R & R Studio.
 Ruby On Rails.
  
  I should be able to spend considerable amount of time on these
